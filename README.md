# Critical Threats in Modern Systems

## 1. Overview  
In today’s ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape, organizations must stay vigilant against emerging threats to protect their digital assets. This project provides a strategic overview of critical security risks, synthesizing real-world data to assess severity, impact, and mitigation strategies. Using authoritative sources such as the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and vendor advisories, we examine **five key vulnerabilities**:  
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** (CVE-2025-2061, CVE-2025-2699) – risks include session hijacking and data theft  
- **SQL Injection** (CVE-2025-2088,  CVE-2025-2951, CVE-2025-2074) – enables unauthorized data access and manipulation  
- **Buffer Overflow** (CVE-2025-1899,  CVE-2024-13903) – can cause system crashes and instability  
- **Remote Code Execution** (CVE-2024-12035) – allows full system compromise  
- **Information Disclosure** (CVE-2024-50310) – exposes sensitive data

## 2. Approach  
1. **Data Collection:** Source CVE details and scores from NVD and vendor advisories  
2. **Data Synthesis:** Categorize vulnerabilities by technical characteristics and impact  
3. **Analysis & Recommendations:** Propose mitigation strategies based on industry best practices
